# 🪙 Collect the Crystals - A 3D Platformer in Unity

**Collect the Crystals** is a fast-paced 3D platformer game developed in Unity 3D as a final project. The goal is simple but thrilling: collect as many floating crystals as possible before time runs out, while navigating challenging platforms and avoiding falls that cost you health.
